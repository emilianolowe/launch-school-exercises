## Understand the Problem
- notes: Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string that contains the original value of the argument with the first character of every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

- input: 'String' argument
- output: return new_string that contains the
  original value of the arg with the first char 
  of every word capitalized and all other lowercase.

- rules:
  - words are any sequence of non-blank char?

- algorithm:
  - Given a string argument, consisting of multiple words
  - break the string into an array of string words, delimited by a space (' ')
  - iterated through each word, capitalizing each words as you go.
  - return string
