Understand the Problem
  Write a Method
    In: Array
    - numbers, strings, etc
    - empty array
    Out: Array 
    - 1st, 3rd, 5th, values and so on

Examples/ Test Cases: 
  oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [2, 4, 6]
  oddities([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [1, 3, 5]
  oddities(['abc', 'def']) == ['abc']
  oddities([123]) == [123]
  oddities([]) == []

Algorithm
Define a Method called 'Oddities' that takes
one Array argument. Iterate through the Array object and delete every other element.
