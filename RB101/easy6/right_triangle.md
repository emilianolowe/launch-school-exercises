## Understand the Problem
- note:
  - "Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right."

- input:
  - positive integer n
- output:
  - display - right triangle whose sides each have n stars.

- rules:
  - the hypotenuse of the triangle (oposite ends), should have one star.
