# Understand the Problem
- notes:
  - the Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21)
    - the first two numbers are 1
    - and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two nums
    - this series appears throughout the natural world
  - simple serious, but results grow at a rapid rate. 

- write a method:
  - calculate (returns) the index of the first fib num that has the number of digits specified as an argument. 

- input:
  - integer that represents the number of digits a number has in a fib sequence
- output:
  - return - the index of the first fib num that has the number of digits (.size == input_num) specified as an arg. 

- req:
  - The first fib number has an index of 1
  - You may assume the arg is always great than or equal to 2

- logic:
