## Understand the Problem
- note: "Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments, and returns a new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments, with the elements taken in alternation."

- input: two arrays
- output: **return** new array containing all elements from arg arrays, with the elem taken in alternation.

- rules:
  - the elem from each array must alternate
  - arr1[0], arr2[0], arr1[1], arr2[1], etc...
  - return a new array
  - You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty, and that they have the same number of elements.

- algorithm:
  - Given two non-empty arrays with the same number of elem

  -
