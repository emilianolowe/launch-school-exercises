# Understand the Problem

## Further exploration
- How many mutating String methods can you find that do not end with a !?
  - <<
  - #clear
  - #concat(obj1, obj2)
  - #replace
  - #insert
  - #prepend

  Hash:

  #clear
  #delete
  #delete_if (same as #reject!)
  #keep_if (same as #select!)
  #rehash (this one is interesting, and "sort of" mutates the original)
  #replace
  #shift
  #store
  #update (same as #merge!)

Array:

  #append (same as #push)
  #clear
  #concat
  #delete
  #delete_at
  #delete_if (same as #reject!)
  #fill
  #insert
  #keep_if (same as #select!)
  #pop
  #prepend (same as #unshift)
  #shift
