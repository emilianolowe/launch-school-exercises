# Understand the Problem
- notes:
  - "Write a method that takes two Arrays as arguments, and returns an Array that contains all of the values from the argument Arrays. There should be no duplication of values in the returned Array, even if there are duplicates in the original Arrays."

- input:
 - 2 array

- output:
  - 1 array that contains all the values from the arg arrays

- rules:
  - There should be no duplication values, even if they exist
    even if they exist in the arg arrays

- algorithm:
  - Add together both arrays into a single dimension array
  - remove any dups
  - return array
